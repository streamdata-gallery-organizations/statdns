description: This is a REST API allowing to perform DNS queries over HTTP, and to
  get reverse PTR records for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. It outputs JSON-encoded
  DNS responses and can be useful in server-side environments where you cannot perform
  DNS queries locally, for client-side Web Applications (including Web browser extensions),
  and for DNS operators. There is no rate limit of any sort at the moment, and the
  service is free for everyone to use.
